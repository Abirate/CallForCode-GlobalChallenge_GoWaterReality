1- FireHydrant: Shapefile of of the Fire Hydrants: main component of the piped water network, used to extinguish fires.

2- FireHydrantPipe : Pipes connecting the Fire Hydrants to the water distribution network.

3- Fitting: Shapefile of of the fittings: important component of the plumbing system, used to join pipes (with any section), there are many types for the water
network: coupling, tee, bend, cross, saddle,etc.

4- WaterDistributionPipe : Shapefile of  the water distribution pipes (connected to the transmission pipes).See WTransmissionPipe, below
